## What is mcsm?
Mcsm(Minecraft server manager) is a project made by java that can manage minecraft servers.
## What can it do?
It can only install a lot of server now. :(
## Why should I use it?
It's great! You can install a paper 1.18.2 server like this:
```shell
java -jar mcsm.jar install https://papermc.io/api/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.18.2/builds/238/downloads/paper-1.18.2-238.jar --name paper1.18.2
```
